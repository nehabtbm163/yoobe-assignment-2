# Assessment 02 - integrate form validation

<p>Task: to build an html contact form validation showing three error messages. One for 'name', another for 'email', and last, 'message'. You are to test for empty value inputs and range values (between 2-40) for the name and email characters and (2-200) characters for the message.<p>

<p>Lesson 11 introduces and has an example of a form validation process</p>
  
  
<p>This exercise is designed to assess your javascript learnings over the course. To do this, you are to integrate an html form (the basis of which is provided in the index.html file) with your assessment one website. Start by creating a 'contact page' (don't forget to add the navigation link so users may access it).</p>
<p>On this contact page, create your contact form and if you wish, add some basic styling.</p>
<p>Once this has been completed and you are happy that your html and css is okay, create a javascript file<p>
<p>This javascript file is designed to validate and interact with the users form information<p>
<p>Everything you need to build a basic form validation is found within the Lesson-11 repository and corresponding online tutorial video</p>
